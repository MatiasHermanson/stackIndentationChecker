# stackIndentationChecker

code in src

Files are read in order and check for indentation. When there is no indentation problems in the file a message in console lets you know that the file is indented properly.
When there is a bad indentation an error is thrown with a message that tells you which line it is at. Code continues after an error is thrown to the next file.
